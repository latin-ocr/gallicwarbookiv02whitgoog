iv PREFACE.

another Latin, or Greek word; at the end os it, if
derived from any other source. Further still, the
primary or etymological meaning is always given,
within inverted commas, in Roman type, and so
much also of each word's history as is neediul to
bring down its chain ol meanings to the especial
force, or forces, attaching to it in the particular
“ Text.'’ In the Vocabularies, however, to Eutropius
and AEsop-which are essentially books sor be·
ginners—the origin is given ol those words alone
which are formed from other Latin or Greek words
respectively.

Moreover, as an acquaintance with the principles
of GRAMMAR, as well as with ETYMOLOGY, is
necessary to the understanding ol a language, such
points ol construction as seem to require elucida—
tion are concisely explained under the proper
articles, or a reference is simply made to that mle
in the Public Schools Latin Pn‘mer, or in Purrsss
Elementavy Greek Grammar, which meets the
particular difficulty. lt occasionally happens, how-
ever, that more insonnation is needed than can be
gathered from the above-named works. When
such is the case, whatever is requisite is supplied,
in substance, from Jelf's Greek Grammar, Winer’r
Grammar of New Testament Greek, or the latire
Grammars of Zumpt and Madvig.
